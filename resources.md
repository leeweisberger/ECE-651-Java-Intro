## Helpful Resources
This is a list of tools that you may find helpful when navigating technologies and teams in this course.
### Core Docs and Tutorials

* [Android developer training](http://developer.android.com/training/index.html), with a series of tutorials, best practices, API guides, and documentation on core libraries.  Going through multiple courses in the “training” section will be essential for building successful Android applications.
* Information on testing – both for [generic Java (JUnit)](http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/testinfected/testing.htm) and an [array of testing tools for Android in particular](http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/testing-tools.html).  Do not neglect testing.
* [Docs and official Oracle tutorial for JavaFX](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/architecture/jfxpub-architecture.htm), a relatively new Java framework for GUIs, as well as [additional resources](https://terrencebarr.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/javafx-2-making-client-apps-sexy-again/) if you decide to go further with this.

### Programming in Java

* [Basic Java problems](http://codingbat.com/) at left to practice your core Java skills.  Good for interview preparation :)
* [Basic Java code “smells,”](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells) or indicators of bad code.  Your code should be free of these.
* [Reading on inheritance](https://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/compsci308/fall15/readings/Mercer_Ch16_part1.pdf) – a core component of Object Oriented programming and an essential idea to master before making large Java programs.
* [Reading on exceptions and how to use them](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2076700/core-java/exceptions-in-java.html), and a [second reading on how to design with them](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2076721/core-java/designing-with-exceptions.html).  Using exceptions is a critical prerequisite for good testing, user experience, etc…
* Advanced – [Java design patterns](http://www.oodesign.com/) that will help you structure almost any large program.

### Teamwork
* [Team-oriented tips](http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/01/7-ways-to-be-a-better-programmer-in-2014.html) on how to be a better programmer.  Good lessons for this course and life in general.
* [Musings on API design](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2073877/core-java/joshua-bloch--a-conversation-about-design.html) – important to understand in order to create usable team code.
* [Puzzle and sandbox game to learn and test Git commands](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/).  Practically useful for all levels of Git experience.
